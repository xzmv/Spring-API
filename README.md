# Spring-API

This project is a bank transaction scheduling API. It allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve bank transaction schedules. The API also calculates a transfer fee based on predefined scheduling rules.

---

## How to Test the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xzmv/Spring-API
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Spring-API
   ```

3. Build the project and run the tests:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   3.1. If you don't have Maven installed, you can download it from the official website: [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

   3.2. Extract the Maven zip file to the directory where you want to install Maven (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven`).

   3.3. Set up the environment variables:
    - Open Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables.
    - Create a new environment variable named `M2_HOME` and set its value to the Maven installation directory.
    - Add the Maven `bin` directory to the system `Path` variable (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\bin`).

   3.4. Verify Maven installation:
    - Open a command prompt and run:
      ```bash
      mvn -v
      ```
    - Ensure Maven's version information is displayed.

4. After the tests pass and the build completes with "BUILD SUCCESS", run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

6. Open Swagger UI in your browser at:
   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   ```

   Use Swagger UI to explore and test all endpoints interactively.
